The `StreetSZ` dataset is a comprehensive multimodal dataset designed for traffic forecasting under anomalous conditions. It includes several types of data, such as:

1. **Traffic Data**: Collected from Shenzhen's transportation platform, including 128,464 entries at consistent 3-hour intervals. Key traffic indicators include:

   * **Traffic Speed** (mean vehicle velocity averaged over standardized 5-minute windows).
   * **Traffic Performance Index (TPI)**, which is the ratio of actual travel time to free-flow travel time.

2. **Meteorological Data**: Weather-related data such as rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and visibility, sourced from the Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau. It also integrates weather forecasts and extreme weather warnings.

3. **Anomalous Event Data**: This includes data related to extreme weather, public holidays, and large-scale events (such as concerts or sports events), categorized and quantified based on their impact on traffic.

4. **Sub-District Metadata**: Includes spatial attributes like area, road density, building footprint, and points of interest (POI) extracted via the Amap API.

The dataset covers **74 sub-districts in Shenzhen**, spanning **April to November 2018**, with the aim of improving traffic forecasting models under exceptional conditions like bad weather or large events .
